# oodle-demo-internal

### Notes:
- This was my first time with Consul. The spec said to ignore if that's the case, but I found it very interesting, so I dug in a bit. I had previously only played with Eureka.

  This is configured to register itself with a Consul container running in my homelab server.
- The External API README has more info.
